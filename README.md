# Advertising Dataset analysis with visualisations

The goal of the analysis is to see the specific Consumer target group of ads being displayed on an online store website.<br>
The project includes different types of graphs to visualise the insights.<br>
I used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
